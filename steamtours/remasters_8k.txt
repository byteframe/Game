I bought 64 gigabytes (wow!) of RAM (randumb access mummery), which is like a kind of food for your computer, and now vrad3 doesnt crash when building 8k lightmaps. Other than 2 junk and 2 fully outdoor environments, I remastered the rest, again.
This isn't (intended to be) self promotion nor do I recommend you actually boot these up in your goggles (though they do look better and if you had to pick one it would be #9), but just some kind of self reward system to cap off what amounted to being much more work than I thought, and of course, reapplying new skills (lighting, texturing, etc) to old releases is very satisifying.
It takes like 18 hours to build each map (though you can more or less do two at a time) and I thought that would be fine and I would just hit a button on each, but of course I wanted to do more rehabs and wasn't disciplined enough to check every little thing before building, so I wasted alot of build time. I certainly got my fill of the '3d or media asset takes forever to render and you have to adjust your whole work/mindspace to deal with it' aspect of digital media production just before everything starts using raytracing hardware. CS2 vrad does this I'm told. Still, I could have been much more diligent and avoid many, many wasted full 8k final builds. I've learned I don't have to upgrade my CPU cooler though, so that's positive.
I also did my best to codify all the things I learned from the steamvr lightmapper into an expansion of the lighting wiki article. The instructional tone clashes somewhat with the more technical breakdown of the original contents, and it was written by someone whose basically never touched the HLA tools, but I think it's still very useful as there are alot of caveats using vrad3.

I'm too lazy (atm) to actually make new screenshots, not that you could tell from most of them the difference between 4k and 8k, but I think it is worth it. I might have missed by chance by updating the submissions to get proper before/after, shucks. Anyway, a lot of really minute shadow detail does show up in the higher resolution and it seems like indrect and AO all gets nicer. Switching some lights to fully baked will also help performance.  I think it was worth it because I really like the look of nice lightmaps both for VR experiences and in regular games  -- incidentally, the original Rage now works on Steam Deck. Thanks for reading!
