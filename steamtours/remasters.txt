
Hi all, I'm working on a big SteamVR project, I hope I can complete it sometime this decade (and might try to form a collection of shots and post those here soon), but in the meantime I took a break to 'relight' and then 'remaster' my current crop of steam environments, (around a dozen). https://steamcommunity.com/id/byteframe/myworkshopfiles/?p=3

Here are the change notes collated into one paste:  https://paste.ee/p/npDwv  Soonish, these updated vmaps and such will be in my github, alongside with the original versions.

Originally, it was going to be a quick and dirty switch from the old vertex lighting system (all my lights were dynamic and expensive, and tons of surfaces were subdivided simply to increase light-triangle density, yeesh) to a fully baked setup with lightmaps. I was set to complete it all in a week or so. If that was a simple change I might not have gone as far as I did making modifications, but I kept learning new things, and snags and complications that forced me work around them in particular ways. Originally I was intent on not doing much work beyond just 'converting' the lighting, but overtime, I eventually went whole hog on just about everything: relighting, total geometry reworks, advanced texture applications/projections, prop distribution, critters, music, beveling and edge normals, etc etc. I didn't go crazy with overlays because the standard crop of steamvr assets doesn't include many. Other than a few additions, I stayed within the current arrangement of asset pack dependencies.

The limitations of this engine (steamvr is old) were front and center, but I like having that clear set of constraints when I'm making something, and working around that. For instance, did you know that baked lights in SteamVR don't have a specular component? You probably did know that, because you read the wiki, but I learned the hard way that my reading comprehension is low. I also learned that foliage props don't cast shadows, or rather, is it props with translucent materials maybe? Furthermore, materials that use the $treesway parameter, will go wild if you attempt to bake lighting on them, so you have to disable it on those props. Turns out you need a thousand gigabytes of ram to build an 8k lightmap, so I had to then do 4k builds with aggressive biasing, another thing I had to learn. Mat_luxels doesn't work so you have to check lightmap density after it's all built. etc etc. One positive note, is that you can build maps outside of hammer with a batch file that calls resourcecompiler (then you move the VPK from your temp folder to the game), so I was able to interate fairly quickly and keep the lightmapper fed. (my room is warm)

There's probably some other weird issues and inconsistencies I could warn mappers about, but generally, the rule of thumb is that everything you see in the editor is being presented in it's fully 'dynamic' form, and you have to use the RT lighting previews to find problems with shadows, etc. I would try to match the before and after by, say, disabling specular rendering on the baked lights, so what I was seeing in the editor would be closer to what would result. On the plus side, 'Fast' builds of even 4k can be pumped out quickly enough, and then you can more easily see distribution of luxels. At the end of the day I was dealing with the age old gamedev problem of which lights are important and which aren't. I kept the environment/suns per pixel, so all the foliage would cast shadows, but internal lights were mostly baked (so no specular, limited shadowing etc) save for various times when I didn't want to break some showpiece area, or it was wise to fill a whole space with just one per pixel light that would do alot of work.

I wasn't really too keen on doing 'before and after' screenshots (lazy), so I'm sorry I don't have much for you to look at here. (Maybe I'll be forced to wrap up a bunch of content into a portfolio some day, but I doubt that). I was generally pleased with the visual upgrades I was forging in the editor. These maps still don't look spectacular in the headset (especially with the Quest 2 on a midrange graphics card), and overall, my work is still 'bad', but I really learned alot about lighting and the final stages of beautification. It's hard to tell because of perf inconsistency (my computer sucks) but I'd like to think each level is raising at least one auto fidelity level along with looking better. The only one that is mostly the same and still runs bad is level 3, the others all recieved quite the sprucing up. My best one still is #9.

I want to try porting one of these levels to Alyx, as it features a more robust lighting and material system that won't hamper me like on SteamVR, so I could learn alot, but I don't plan to release them there. Before that though, since I finally finished this month or so of 'old work' I can finally allow myself to play Bonelab.

edit: screw it, I made a demo reel (might as well): https://twitter.com/byteframe/status/1590430049832165376 I'm sorry it's on twitter.
