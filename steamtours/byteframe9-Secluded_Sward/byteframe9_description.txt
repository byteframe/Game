Welcome to the White Puerta Research Facility. Not much to say about the development of this. Getting better and really stuck the alignment, but its still a dolled up small space that (at least at first) seemed to look a bit meh. Building mesh has some problems but I wasn't going to make it a third time. I can do better with more thoughtful house templates. Everything was maleable enough and it help up. After cubemaps (alot of them) everything looks pretty good I'd say. It shows an improvement in form, but not technique. Got sufficiently proppy this time too, but its not too bad. This looks better than most of all my other stuff so I'll take it, but I think I need to take a break from mapping because I'm bad at it.
