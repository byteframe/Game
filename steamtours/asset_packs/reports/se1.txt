Here are all the materials and models from Sin Episodes Emergence converted into the Source 2 format for use in your VR environments! Please see https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2094270469 for more information on these asset packs. In the case of this game, I did not (unlike cstrike/dod) build the mod referencing of a set of hl2 files, so, like Portal 2, the Sin Episodes pack contains various duplications of Half Life 2 content that shipped with the game. Culling the handfuls of cardboard boxes, etc, might have been desirable, but I don't have the ability (source files) or want to properly check against the base half life 2 game files. Also, Sin isn't really a addon(vpk wise) to Half-Life 2 like css/dod, came out way before Steam Pipe and Source 2013, is not a Valve game etc, so it might be proper to just ship all the files verbatim like here. This is all more of a personal note.

In any event, the amount of duplicated content seems quite small, everything builds (except the eyeballs and skys of course.) I used the default script converter refraction maximum of 0.050, instead of lowering it, as I want a bit more shininess in the map I'm working on.  I'm unsure at this point if the scripts I ran were the same ones from last time, or even if any improvements to them are available. I didn't have to do anything to get the (likely hl2) blend materials to work, and overall my procedure was honed and I built the pack in a night, I hope I didn't make a mistake. Some characters didn't build until typos were fixed, and some quick bash/sed fixed the missing files. The missing files seem to be endless amounts of alpha masks, and I presume this is junk output from the material converter script, and there are plenty of transparent materials properly converted. Finger's crossed.

The only content culled from release was the following debug/dev files:

-- materials/debug/
-- materials/engine/
-- materials/hlmv/
-- materials/shadertest/
-- materials/tools/
-- materials/vgui/hud
-- materials/models/editor/
-- models/editor/
-- models/error
